Image Encryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation! 
# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview
This is a simple image encryption and decryption tool that utilizes pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to encrypt an image by altering its pixel values and decrypt it back to its original state.

## Features
- Encrypts images using basic mathematical operations on pixel values.
- Decrypts images to restore the original data.
- Built with Python using the Pillow library for image processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You also need to install the Pillow library:

```bash
pip install pillow
Usage
Place your image in the same directory as the script and rename it to input_image.jpg.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python image_encryptor.py

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8576d5a-f2c1-4ee9-8906-d8cff67b540b)
The encrypted image will be saved as encrypted_image.jpg, and the decrypted image will be saved as decrypted_image.jpg.
Example
Input Image: input_image.jpg
Encrypted Image: encrypted_image.jpg (This image will appear scrambled)
Decrypted Image: decrypted_image.jpg (This should match the original input image)
